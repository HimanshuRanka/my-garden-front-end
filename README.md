for the app. It is written using the ReactNative framework.
It is linked to the backend via heroku, the backend code can
be found at [MyGarden Backend](https://github.com/KeshavC217/my-garden.git)

## Running the application
You need to have Node installed into your system. Then use that to install expo.
```shell script
npm install -g expo-cli  
``` 
You also need to install React Navigation packages
```shell script
npm install @react-navigation/native
```
Once you clone the repo on your own system and cd into the right directory run
```shell script
expo install  
expo start
```
Then download the expo app on your phone. Use it to scan the 
QR code and run the app.
You could also run on an emulator.
